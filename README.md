The data used here is from the [Center for Medicare & Medicaid Services (CMS)](https://data.cms.gov/browse?q=Medicare%20Provider%20Utilization%20and%20Payment%20Data%3A%20Part%20D%20Prescriber%20Summary%20Table%20CY2014&sortBy=relevance) for the years 2013-2016. Each file is a list of physicians who see Medicare Part D beneficiaries, with variables such as demographics, total claim counts, opioid claim counts, number of 30 day fills, and opioid prescription rates, among others.
